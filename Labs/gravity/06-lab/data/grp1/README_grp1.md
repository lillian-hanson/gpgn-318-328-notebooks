Description of Measurment Marking Setup:
Let +x be along the survey line in the direction towards Hill Hall (eastword). Let 0 be the decided center on the survey line. Let -x be along the survey line in the direction towards Kafadar Commons (westward). Measurements were take in 0.5m increments from 0m up to $\pm$5m, and in 1m increments from $\pm$5m to $\pm$9m.
