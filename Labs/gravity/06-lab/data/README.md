### Goal:
Design and perform a surface gravity survey to detect the underground steam tunnel running parallel to Green Center.

### Methods:
#### 1) Layout your survey
Setup and mark your survey locations on the ground.

#### 2) Accurately measure the spatial locations
Using an appropriately accurate device, measure the station locations.

#### 3) Measure Gravity
Using the gravimeters measure the anomaly of the tunnel. Remember to visit a base station often enough to accurately correct for instrument drift.

#### 4) Retain Data
Afterwards, download the spatial and gravity data from the instruments.

### Group 1 Members:

### Group 2 Members:
Lillian, Molly, Rory, Clara, Erica, Emily, Chandler, Ben

### Data Context
- The two parallel survey lines, each pependicular to the steam tunnel, were 18.25 m apart.
- Group 2 denoted the survey placings with the center of the tunnel as 0, with values ranging to 10 m out on either side, the westward side (the side pointing to kafadar) being denoted as the negative axis.
