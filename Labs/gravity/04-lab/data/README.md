# Lab 4
## GPGN318
 **Date:** 2025-09-18

**Location:** Colorado School of Mines, Golden, Colorado

We took gravimeter measurements at the following locations:
- **Location 1:** Gravity station outside of Green Center
- **Location 2:** Alderson Hall - first floor
- **Location 3:** Alderson Hall - fourth floor

We went to each location in the following order:

Location 1 -> Location 2 -> Location 3 -> Location 2 -> Location 1

### Objective
Use relative gravimeters to measure the radius of the Earth in Golden.

### Data
CG5 measurements can be found in the CG5-1.TXT and CG5-2.TXT files. LNR measurements are contained in the LNR_gravimeter.xlsx file.

Notes:
- Measurement 4 at Location 1 for the CG5 gravimeters should be discarded during analysis because the class introduced intentional noise by jumping around.
- The height distance between the bottom floor of Alderson and the 4th floor is 40 ft.

### Procedure
#### LaCoste and Romberg (LNR) Model G gravity meter
Getting measurements:
1) Level the gravimeter by adjusting the screws and aligning the leveling bubbles.
2) Unlock the spring
3) Turn the light on
4) Looking into the eyepiece, use the adjustment dial to get the scale to read 2.4 (ensure the reading is stable)
5) Record the reading next to the adjustment dial
7) Convert measurement values according to manual guide

#### Scintrex CG-5 gravimeter
Getting measurements:
1) Ensure the station label is correct
2) Level the instrument until the black axis line align in the center circle (you should get a smiley face)
3) Press measure and move away from the instrument
4) The blue light indicates it is in the process of taking measurements- reduce movement while this is happening
5) Save the measurement

### Equipment
- LNR gravimeter
- 2 CG-5 gravimeters
- 2 measuring tapes
